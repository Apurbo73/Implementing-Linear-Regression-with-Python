### Implementing Linear Regression with Python
### ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning: Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is one of the simplest and most commonly used algorithms in **supervised learning**, particularly for **regression tasks**.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression attempts to model the relationship between a **dependent variable** $y$ and one (or more) **independent variables** $x$ by fitting a **linear equation** to the observed data.

### ðŸ”¸ Simple Linear Regression Equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

* $y$: target (output)
* $x$: input (feature)
* $m$: slope (coefficient)
* $b$: intercept (bias)

### ðŸ”¸ Multiple Linear Regression:

$$
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
$$

Where $w_i$ are the weights (coefficients) for each feature $x_i$.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Goal of Linear Regression

To find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) by minimizing the **error** between predicted and actual values, typically using:

### ðŸ”¸ Cost Function: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

$$
J(w, b) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

* $y_i$: actual value
* $\hat{y}_i$: predicted value
* $n$: number of data points

## ðŸ”¹ 3. How It Works

1. Initialize weights and bias (e.g., to zero)
2. Make predictions: $\hat{y} = w \cdot x + b$
3. Compute the loss (e.g., MSE)
4. Use **Gradient Descent** to minimize the loss:

   * Update weights:

     $$
     w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}
     $$
   * Update bias:

     $$
     b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}
     $$
   * $\alpha$ is the learning rate

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. Linearity
2. Independence of errors
3. Homoscedasticity (constant variance of error terms)
4. No multicollinearity (for multiple regression)
5. Normally distributed errors

* Predicting house prices
* Forecasting sales
* Stock market trend analysis
* Estimating customer spending
